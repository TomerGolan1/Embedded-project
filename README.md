Real-time API between the computer and a Micro-controller which interfaces with
a joystick and a motor.
There are 4 working modes:
1. A motor which can point to any direction, follows the joystick immedietly on real time.
2. Paint in Pc which draw/erase/move immedietly according to the joystick movement.
3. A calibrate mode for the first use to determine the angle which the stepper motor moves by one step.
4. Sending scripts from the Pc to the micro-Controller which are saved on his Flash during the first use.
   Each script can make the micro-controller to do variable functions.
